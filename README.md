# hdpca - Principal Component Analysis in High-Dimensional Data

## In high-dimensional settings:

+ Estimate the number of distant spikes based on the Generalized Spiked Population (GSP) model.
	
+ Estimate the population eigenvalues, angles between the sample and population eigenvectors, correlations between the sample and population PC scores, and the asymptotic shrinkage factors.
	
+ Adjust the shrinkage bias in the predicted PC scores.
